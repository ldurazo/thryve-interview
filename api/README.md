Food Nutrition API
There are two portions to this challenge: a backend REST API and a frontend web application that consumes the API.

Backend REST API
Prerequisites
Use this file for the raw nutrition data: https://tinyurl.com/y7rqmp7t
Python and Flask is preferred, but you are free to also use Javascript and any JS framework.
Provide a RESTful API to accommodate necessary functionality.
Your solution should be robust and able to gracefully handle various conditions.
Output format should be JSON.
User Story
As a user, I want to find foods with a combination of the following nutrients within a certain range.

Example: a user should be able to call the API endpoint wanting to find foods over 1 gram of protein and/or 2 grams of sugar. The system should then list out the foods that contain those properties.
Specs
Endpoint URL: /foods
Frontend Web Application
Prerequisites
Create a user-friendly interface for your REST API.
React.js is preferred, but you are free to use any front-end tech stack youâ€™d like.
Bonus (optional)
Host your API and webapp so they are publically accessible! For free cloud hosting, we recommend using Heroku.
